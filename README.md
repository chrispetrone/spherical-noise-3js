# Spherical Noise

Sound reactive noise applied to a icosahedron (geodesic sphere)

## todo
- typescript?
- apply noise filter to planes
- use shaders
- map sound to lights
- experiment with different backgrounds
    - possibly more spheres with different noise filter configs
- dynamic sensitivity (ie. mapping)
    - rather than having static predefined mappings, map relatively based on recent values
- unit tests :grimacing: :sweat_smile:
