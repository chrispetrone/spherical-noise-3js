# Spherical Noise

noise applied to a icosahedron (geodesic sphere)

https://forum.processing.org/two/discussion/26718/how-to-correctly-apply-perlin-noise-to-a-sphere

## todo
- get build configuration to work with github static sites
    - rename docs to build hopefully
    - avoid manually copying index.html
- apply noise filter to planes
- map sound to lights
- experiment with different backgrounds
    - possibly more spheres with different noise filter configs
- dynamic sensitivity (ie. mapping)
    - rather than having static predefined mappings, map relatively based on recent values
